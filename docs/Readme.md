Misc Information

SPsauce pulls an instance of sourcemod and all declared dependencies into a cache directory within the project.
The compiler will be located in ./spcache/addons/sourcemod/scripting/ and dependencies will be placed around it.
A built in `spcomp`-Task automatically add some common include directories, and can run in paralell with other compiles.

**Archives are best structured with an addons/sourcemod directory no more than 1 directory deep.** This allows the tool to
easily find your project root. A single subdirectory is automatically generated by GitHub when downloading a zip or
tarball or a repository branch, but more subdirectories should work as well.

Additionally you can call other applications from withing the build-script, if the provided functionallity is not enough.
Keep in mind that all file targets are limited to subdirectories wherever possible.

Execution is done in three phases: Parse, dependency resolution, task execution. The second phase  will already

**On Authentication:** I know Git Hub PATs are a bit iffy, but without the API allows for only [60 requests per hour](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting) and that's abysmal! If you can't use
`clone` or want to use spsauce with another build system, you can always create a read only PAT (without scopes).
